## 📝 What You Need to Do Now

### **Step 1: Activate Plugin (Required)**

1. Go to: https://firstindallas.com/wp-admin/plugins.php
2. Find **"Events CMS Directory"** (version 1.1.1)
3. Click **"Activate"**
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
5. Refresh events calendar page

### **Step 2: Test Events Display**

Visit: https://firstindallas.com/events-calendar/

**Expected:** Regular events list should display ✅  
**Note:** Featured events section will NOT show yet (disabled)

---

## 🔄 About Featured Events

### **Current State:**
- ✅ Backend: Database & API ready (100% complete)
- ⏸️ Frontend: Featured section code disabled (as safety measure)

### **Why Disabled?**
During troubleshooting the 500 error, I removed the featured events code from the plugin to isolate the issue. Turns out the 500 error wasn't caused by our plugin at all.

### **To Enable Featured Events (After Confirming Events Work):**

I can restore the featured events code by:
1. Uncommenting the featured section call
2. Re-adding the featured functions  
3. Updating to version 1.2.0
4. Uploading via FTP

Then you'll need to create at least 1 featured event booking to see the section appear.
